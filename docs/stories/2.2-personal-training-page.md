# Story 2.2: Personal Training Landing Page

Status: Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** frontend engineer,  
**I want** to build the `/personal-training` page with premium coaching messaging,  
**so that** prospects understand the 1:1 offering and convert via Start 1:1 CTAs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/personal-training` includes hero, "Built for your goals" three-card section, InBody callout, four-step process grid, coach showcase, testimonials, and CTA bar matching the handoff structure.
2. New supporting components (`InfoCards`, `InBodyCallout`, `StepsGrid`, `TestimonialStrip`) are responsive, accessible, and reuse design tokens; coach grid links to `/coaches/[slug]` entries with valid data sourced from `docs/architecture/content-coaches.md`.
3. Primary/secondary CTAs (`Start 1:1`, `Get Day Pass`, membership link) function correctly, carry `data-cta` values, and maintain contrast across light/dark sections.
4. Content placeholders (copy, imagery) are sourced from content collections or fixtures with clear TODO markers for future content pipeline handoff.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement `/personal-training` route composing sections per page plan with existing layout primitives (AC 1)
- [x] Create reusable `InfoCards` component for three-pillar grid with icon/image support and DS spacing (AC 1, AC 2)
- [x] Build `InBodyCallout` component (image + copy layout) including CTA to `/membership` and responsive stacking (AC 1, AC 2, AC 3)
- [x] Implement four-step `StepsGrid` with numbered badges, accessible semantics, and reduced-motion friendly transitions (AC 1, AC 2)
- [x] Integrate coach grid leveraging `/coaches` content spec in `docs/architecture/content-coaches.md`; add fallback state until data available (AC 1, AC 2, AC 4)
- [x] Add testimonial strip component accepting structured props for quotes/images and placeholder data file (AC 1, AC 2, AC 4)
- [x] Instrument CTAs with `data-cta` slugs (`personal-training-start`, etc.) and ensure analytics helper coverage (AC 3)
- [x] Document component APIs in README or component docs for future reuse on other pages (AC 2, AC 4)

## Dev Notes
- Align copy/section order with `page_plan/personal_training_page_different_breed.md` and design tokens from Story 1.5.
- Pending assets (InBody photography, testimonials) can use temporary placeholders flagged in TODO comments for content team.
- Hero should support video or image backgrounds similar to Story 1.7 implementation.
- Consider centralizing testimonial data in `src/content/testimonials/` for reuse across pages.
- Ensure coaches section gracefully handles fewer than three entries (responsive stacking, alt text on portraits).
- Use bios and focus tags from `docs/architecture/content-coaches.md` for initial seed data; keep mapping between slugs and `/coaches` collection consistent.

### Testing
- Component-level tests for CTA tracking payloads and layout snapshot where feasible.
- Manual QA: verify responsive layout at key breakpoints (360px, 768px, 1280px), link navigation, and keyboard navigation order.
- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` to ensure stability.

- Composed `/personal-training` route with hero, info cards, InBody callout, steps grid, coach showcase, testimonial strip, sticky mobile CTA, and closing CTA bar with analytics instrumentation.
- Added server-compatible Formspree CTA hooks and documented component usage plus TODO guidance in `README.md`.
- Created unit tests (`tests/unit/personal-training.test.ts`) verifying personal training content integrity.
- Rebuilt `CoachGrid` to present first-name portrait tiles with hover/focus overlay revealing details, tags, and CTA while keeping semantic HTML and keyboard support.
- Adjusted coach tiles for edge-to-edge top-aligned photography, swapped updated PNG headshots for the full roster (Michelle, Don, Joe, Glenda, Matthew, Ricardo, Daniel, Carlos, Aad√°m, Pablo, Coach D.R.E.D.), and added subtle hover zoom to portraits.
