# Story 2.3: "What Makes Us Different" About Page

Status: Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** frontend engineer,  
**I want** to ship the `/about` page showcasing philosophy, facility, equipment, and community,  
**so that** visitors understand the brand difference and convert via CTA prompts.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/about` renders hero, philosophy pillars, facility mosaic with lightbox, equipment grid, coach preview, community gallery, testimonial proof, and closing CTA bar consistent with the handoff.
2. Visual components (`PillarCards`, `PhotoMosaic`, `EquipmentGrid`, community gallery) are accessible, responsive, and alternate light/dark backgrounds while preserving design token spacing.
3. Photo mosaic/lightbox supports keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and graceful fallback when media missing; testimonials and CTAs include `data-cta` instrumentation and correct destination links (`/personal-training`, `/coaches`, `/contact`).
4. Content sections pull from structured data sources (e.g., `src/content`) or placeholder JSON with clear TODOs for content ops.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Compose `/about` route with section scaffolding and shared layout primitives (AC 1)
- [ ] Implement `PillarCards` component (three-pillars grid) with iconography support and semantic headings (AC 1, AC 2)
- [ ] Build `PhotoMosaic` + lightbox interaction with accessible keyboard controls, captions, and responsive breakpoints (AC 1, AC 2, AC 3)
- [ ] Create `EquipmentGrid` component with bullet lists, optional CTAs, and dark/light theming (AC 1, AC 2, AC 3)
- [ ] Add community gallery module (carousel or mosaic) with quotes overlay and reduced-motion handling (AC 1, AC 2)
- [ ] Integrate testimonial proof section leveraging shared `TestimonialStrip` (from Story 2.2) and content fixtures (AC 1, AC 4)
- [ ] Wire CTA buttons and inter-page links (`/personal-training`, `/coaches`, day pass) with analytics attributes (AC 3)
- [ ] Document data sources and TODO placeholders for content upload (AC 4)

## Dev Notes
- Follow structure/copy seeds in `page_plan/what_makes_us_different_page_different_breed.md`.
- Ensure lightbox respects prefers-reduced-motion and traps focus until closed (`Escape` key support).
- Alternate background themes to maintain visual rhythm (e.g., tokens for light/dark sections) and maintain 128px vertical spacing.
- Coordinate with content team for facility imagery and testimonials; use placeholder assets stored under `public/` with clear naming.
- Consider reusing coach data from `/coaches` collection; show top three coaches with CTA to full index.

### Testing
- Write integration test or Storybook-like snapshot for lightbox focus trapping logic if feasible.
- Manual QA: keyboard-only navigation, screen reader labels for mosaic items, responsive layout across breakpoints.
- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` to validate.
