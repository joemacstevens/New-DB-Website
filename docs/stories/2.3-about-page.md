# Story 2.3: "What Makes Us Different" About Page

Status: Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** frontend engineer,  
**I want** to ship the `/about` page showcasing philosophy, facility, equipment, and community,  
**so that** visitors understand the brand difference and convert via CTA prompts.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `/about` renders hero, philosophy pillars, facility mosaic with lightbox, equipment grid, coach preview, community gallery, testimonial proof, and closing CTA bar consistent with the handoff.
2. Visual components (`PillarCards`, `PhotoMosaic`, `EquipmentGrid`, community gallery) are accessible, responsive, and alternate light/dark backgrounds while preserving design token spacing.
3. Photo mosaic/lightbox supports keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and graceful fallback when media missing; testimonials and CTAs include `data-cta` instrumentation and correct destination links (`/personal-training`, `/coaches`, `/contact`).
4. Content sections pull from structured data sources (e.g., `src/content`) or placeholder JSON with clear TODOs for content ops.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Compose `/about` route with section scaffolding and shared layout primitives (AC 1)
- [x] Implement `PillarCards` component plus `PillarCards.module.css` (three-pillars grid) with iconography support and semantic headings (AC 1, AC 2)
- [x] Build `PhotoMosaic` & `PhotoMosaic.module.css` lightbox interaction with accessible keyboard controls, captions, and responsive breakpoints (AC 1, AC 2, AC 3)
- [x] Create `EquipmentGrid` component with `EquipmentGrid.module.css` for bullet lists, optional CTAs, and dark/light theming (AC 1, AC 2, AC 3)
- [x] Add community gallery module (`CommunityGallery.astro` + `CommunityGallery.module.css`) with quotes overlay and reduced-motion handling (AC 1, AC 2)
- [x] Integrate testimonial proof section leveraging shared `TestimonialStrip` (from Story 2.2) and content fixtures (AC 1, AC 4)
- [x] Wire CTA buttons and inter-page links (`/personal-training`, `/coaches`, day pass) with analytics attributes (AC 3)
- [x] Document data sources and TODO placeholders for content upload (AC 4)

## Dev Notes
- Follow structure/copy seeds in `page_plan/what_makes_us_different_page_different_breed.md`.
- Ensure lightbox respects prefers-reduced-motion and traps focus until closed (`Escape` key support).
- Alternate background themes to maintain visual rhythm (e.g., tokens for light/dark sections) and maintain 128px vertical spacing.
- Coordinate with content team for facility imagery and testimonials; use placeholder assets stored under `public/` with clear naming.
- Consider reusing coach data from `/coaches` collection; show top three coaches with CTA to full index.
- Community mosaic layout: 5–6 tiles with one 2× hero tile anchoring the grid, two medium tiles, and smaller accent tiles; reuse premium hover treatments (soft elevation, red glow) and ensure hover/focus overlays include captions + optional CTA without triggering autoplay.

### Testing
- Write integration test or Storybook-like snapshot for lightbox focus trapping logic if feasible.
- Manual QA: keyboard-only navigation, screen reader labels for mosaic items, responsive layout across breakpoints.
- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` to validate.

### Completion Notes List

- Assembled `src/pages/about.astro` with alternating light/dark section rhythm, premium dividers, and CTA instrumentation for hero, facility tour, and final CTA bar.
- Delivered new premium components (`PillarCards`, `PhotoMosaic`, `EquipmentGrid`, `CommunityGallery`) with accompanying CSS modules leveraging shared surface utilities and reduced-motion fallbacks.
- Added `src/content/about.ts` to centralize hero copy, pillars, facility media metadata, equipment features, community highlights, and testimonial seeds for reuse.
- Implemented accessible lightbox for the facility mosaic with keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and CTA passthrough, plus community gallery overlays for quotes.
- Extended test coverage with `tests/unit/about.test.ts` ensuring content scaffolding integrity and kept schedule helpers lint-compliant after buildSessions refactor.
